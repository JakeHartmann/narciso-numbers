# Narciso Numbers
This is my first project in GitHub, and I had this idea while watching a Vsauce2 video. 
[Click here](https://jakehartmann.github.io/narciso-numbers/) to go to the website.

The so called [Narcissistic Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number) are special numbers that when split into digits, and then having the sum of these same digits powered to the length of total digits, results in the original number again.
